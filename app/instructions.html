<p>
  Under the guidance of a Game Moderator, a game plays out as an
  alternating series of nights and days.

  During the night, the players all have their eyes closed, and then, in turn,
  the Game Moderator will ask the nocturnal characters to open their eyes (to wake up)
  and use their power. When all of the nocturnal roles have been called, the Moderator will
  ask all of the players to open their eyes (the village wakes up).

  Each day, when the village wakes up, the possible victimes of the nocturnal characters
  will be revealed. Then, all of the remaining players will debate to eliminate
  via a vote one of themselves in the fragile hope of managing to guarantee the village's survival.

  The goal of each player depends on their secret identity.


  <h3> Set Up </h3>

  The Game Moderator is selected. They will not play, but instead will lead the game.

  The Game Moderator shuffles the required cards and then they deal each player
  a face-down card. Each player discreetly looks at their character card, then places it face-down
  in front of themselves.


  <h3>Game Overview</h3>

  It is strictly forbidden to reveal your own character card to anyone while your character
  is alive. However with speaking, anything goes.

  The Moderator will follow the character call-out table to lead the game.

  <h4> The Moderator puts the village to sleep: </h4>

    All the players lower their heads and close their eyes. The Moderator then calls in turn
    the various night characters in play and tells them what to do without mentioning who
    they are.

  <h4> When they've all been called, the Moderator wakes up the village: </h4>

    The Moderator informs the village who have been the victims of the night. Then the
    village debates any possible suspicions. The Moderates organizes and moderates
    these debates.

    All players are allowed to pass themselves off as another character.
    This phase is the core of the game; this is the time to bluff or tell the truth
    but the key is to always be credible.

  <h4> When the time is right, the Moderator starts the village's vote: </h4>

    The players nominate who they want to lynch that day.
    The players are supposed to eliminate a player suspected of compromising the
    village's survival. The player with the most votes is eliminated.
    The eliminated player reveals their card and is no longer allowed to contribute
    to the game.

    The game shifts over to night time and repeats until all the werewolves are killed
    or there are more werewolves than villagers.
